# CPTS-315-Anime-Recommendation

* This is a school project created in Python. It takes a large dataset of anime titles and their rankings as well as the user ids and user ratings of each show, mined from MyAnimeList, found on Kaggle (dataset too big to upload on github), and outputs a list of recommended shows for the user, split between video formats, in separate csv files.

* [Kaggle link](www.kaggle.com/datasets/azathoth42/myanimelist) to mined dataset.

* Last updated on: 13th Dec 2022, as the Term Project for the course Cpts 315 - Introduction to Data Mining.

* This program was written in VS Code. To run, import files to local system and run on VS Code.
